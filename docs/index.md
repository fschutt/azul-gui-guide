# Welcome

The azul GUI toolkit is a free, functional, MVVM-oriented
GUI framework for rapid prototyping of desktop applications
written in Rust, supported by the Mozilla WebRender rendering engine.

This is the official documentation on how to use the Azul GUI toolkit.
It will walk you through your first application, the concepts of Azul
(state management, layout, tasks, deamons, dynamic CSS values, SVG drawing).

The API itself is documented seperately at [https://docs.rs/azul](https://docs.rs/azul).
This documentation is merely "supplementary" so you can understand the concepts
used by Azul and how to effectively use it.
